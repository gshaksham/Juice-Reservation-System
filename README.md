# -BOOKING-ORDER-FOR-JUICE

The project booking order for juice is all about managing the record of all the customers who book the order from the juice center. People usually visit various juice corners every 
day. It’s impossible to do all of work manually in today’s juice corners because they are so crowded. This is why people may use this project in order to improve their workflow and 
performance. This project helps you to save time, effort, and complexity by reducing the amount of work you have to do. We can also save papers by calculating it in the system. This project 
is purely based on the concepts of data structure in c programming language. It is helpful for the workers who maintain the record of the customer and order details 
because this project includes a menu based concept in which there are certain options for managing the data. This full project is made using Turbo C\C++ software. In this project, our principle aim is to efficiently manage customer’s detail and their order 
details. This project works without internet connections, so any juice corner can use this project.
